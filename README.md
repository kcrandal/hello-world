# hello-world
Introduction repository - the first step in changing jobs.
I have a doctorate in Ancient Near Eastern History, but no ability to get a job in my field.
As a result, I am more or less "stuck" at an easy dead-end job teaching English in South Korea.
I hope that coding will provide me with sufficient skills to allow upward mobility - hopefully one not involved in teaching English and perhaps not even in Korea.
